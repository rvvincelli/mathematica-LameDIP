This package is intended to be a first helping hand to those who want to delve into digital image processing using Mathematica rather than Matlab or (even worse! :D) Photoshop/Gimp.
It presents some basic functions and can be seen as a lame alternative to the Digital Image Processing package by Wolfram. I think a good deal of the code is to be upgraded, but, on 8, everything still works.
Contents:
-Some eyecandy functions to generate impressive images (decompositions, neonish effects etc...) by applying builtin functions to images
-Basic statistics to compare images: focusing on the differences between images, the contrast of an image.
-Color space transformations operating on triples; you can always try something like applying them to image data and create a new image from the result...
